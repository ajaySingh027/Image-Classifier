# Image-Classifier
Implemented a convolutional neural network to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.


## Description
In this project, I trained an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. 
Imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells us the name of the flower our camera is looking at. 
In practice I trained this classifier, then exported it for use in our application. 
And used this dataset of 102 flower categories.


The project is broken down into multiple steps:
- Load and preprocess the image dataset
- Train the image classifier on your dataset
- Use the trained classifier to predict image content
